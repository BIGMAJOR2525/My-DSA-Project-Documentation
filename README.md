### Case Study 2: Palmora Group HR Analysis

CASE SCENARIO
● Analyse the company data and generate insights that the Palmoria management
team would need to address
● Your analysis should be visualised using appropriate charts
● Your focus should be on gender-related issues within the organization and its
regions
● The insights required are based on your discretion. However, Mr Gamma, as an
insider, has offered to give you pointers on areas you need to pay attention to
Required:
● Generally, there are two genders in the organization. However, some employees
refused to disclose their gender. You would need to assign a generic gender status
to these employees
● Some employees are without a salary because they are no longer with the company.
You will need to take those employees out
● Lastly, some departments are indicated as “NULL”. These departments would also
need to be taken out.
Pointers from Mr Gamma
1. What is the gender distribution in the organization? Distil to regions and
departments
2. Show insights on ratings based on gender
3. Analyse the company’s salary structure. Identify if there is a gender pay gap. If
there is, identify the department and regions that should be the focus of
management
4. A recent regulation was adopted which requires manufacturing companies to pay
employees a minimum of $90,000
● Does Palmoria meet this requirement?
● Show the pay distribution of employees grouped by a band of $10,000. For example:
● How many employees fall into a band of $10,000 – $20,000, $20,000 – $30,000,
etc.?
● Also visualize this by regions
Case Questions
5. Mr Gamma thought to himself that since you were already working on the employee
data, you could help out with allocating the annual bonus pay to employees based on the
performance rating. He handed you another data set that contains rules for making bonus
payments and asked you to:
● Calculate the amount to be paid as a bonus to individual employees
● Calculate the total amount to be paid to individual employees (salary inclusive of
bonus)
● Total amount to be paid out per region and company-wide
